# IRON DOME

This repository contains MATLAB scripts designed to track the trajectory of a projectile, predict its impact point, and calculate the interception point for missile defense systems. The program utilizes radar input and wind speed data to make accurate predictions.

## Features

- **Projectile Trajectory Tracking**: Utilizes radar data to track the trajectory of the incoming projectile.
- **Wind Speed Adjustment**: Incorporates wind speed data to adjust the predicted path of the projectile.
- **Impact Point Prediction**: Calculates the estimated impact point of the projectile.
- **Interception Point Calculation**: Determines the optimal interception point for missile defense systems.

## Requirements

- MATLAB: Ensure MATLAB is installed on your system to run the scripts.
- Radar Data: Input radar data is required for tracking the projectile.
- Wind Speed Data: Wind speed information should be provided for accurate predictions.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/projectile-tracking.git
